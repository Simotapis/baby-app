# React App Implementation Plan for Weather Dashboard

## Project Overview
Based on the mockup provided, we'll implement a weather dashboard application with the following features:
- Navigation between pages
- Data integration with weather APIs
- Data persistence using local storage or a database
- Form validation for search and settings
- Data visualization for weather metrics
- Export functionality for weather data

## Core Features Implementation

### 1. Routing and Navigation
We'll use React Router to handle navigation between pages:
- Dashboard (Home)
- Forecast Details
- Settings
- Saved Locations

### 2. Weather API Integration
We'll integrate with a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to fetch:
- Current weather data
- Forecast data
- Historical weather data

### 3. Data Persistence
Options:
- Local Storage for user preferences and saved locations
- Firebase/Supabase for more robust cloud storage (optional)

### 4. Form Validation
Implement validation for:
- Location search
- Units preferences
- Alert settings

### 5. Data Visualization
Use libraries like Recharts or Chart.js to visualize:
- Temperature trends
- Precipitation forecasts
- Wind patterns
- Other weather metrics

### 6. Export Functionality
Allow users to export:
- Weather reports as PDF
- Weather data as CSV/JSON
- Charts as images

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up React project and install dependencies
2. Create basic components and layout
3. Implement routing
4. Connect to weather API
5. Implement data persistence
6. Add visualization components
7. Build form validation
8. Add export functionality
9. Polish UI and user experience
